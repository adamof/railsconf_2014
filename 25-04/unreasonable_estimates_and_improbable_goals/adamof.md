Unreasonable Estimates and Improbable Goals
---

### Deal with uncertainty
Deal with it upfront
You can and should change your estimates

- do the uncertain things first
- re-estimate as you learn
- communicate often

### Defense against the dark arts - Estimation bargaining

- you can't negotiate time
- you can negotiate features
- you can re-estimate as you learn

_Give people estimates that are true, not the will make them happy_

### Complexity costs - You can, but should you?

*Implementation costs*
Watch for cross cutting concerns

*Operational costs*
Are you introducing new architecture?
- how will you test it?
- how will you monitor it?
- how will you deploy it?

*Support costs*
Features can be technically simple, but conceptually difficult
Will your
- user understand it?
- support team understand it?
- business understand it?

*Opportunity costs*
What is the priority of this work?
- for you
- for your team
- for the business

*Weigh the costs*

### Ego manipulation
Don't let your ego get you into trouble. Stand by your estimates.

### Deadlines

*Soft deadlines - goals*

*Hard deadlines - promises*

Dealing with it

Dev favourite:
- ship late
- cut features
- - make sure we don't cut performance, tests, stability

PM favourites:
- add people
- - overhead
- work overtime
- - not sustainable

### Deadline hardening
Don't commit to making any deadlines you can't meet.
Saying you will try = commiting
