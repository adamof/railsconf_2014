in rails world
- write html erb
- server has an API for the client
- client side keeps mustache or underscore js templates

turbolinks
- write just server side
- pop in new pages without losing the brwoser instance
- client is extremely simple

ember/angular/backbone
- server has an API for the client
- entire app experience lives on client
- initial page load downloads entire js "app", builds page
- new twitter

"perspectives"
- same template on the client/server

lowest common denominator

dumbest possible templates

mustache
- logic less => "can't run arbitrary code"
- tags

"Perspectives::Base"

```ruby
  property(:foo) { }
```

HTML: unstructured data
JSON: structured data

Couple client with structured data
