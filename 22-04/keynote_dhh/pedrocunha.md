Writing software

"You should have start writing program for 10y or you are too behind"
3y as programmer before starting rails

Computer science allows us to do what we do, but does not define what we do

Just because you are a great computer science guy, does not mean you will be
a good engineer

Computer science is not the ultimal idea

there are some laws that are just science

When people think they are doing science 

This code is dirty
"I'm not a computer science"

salvation: patterns & patterns

i tried multiple times TDD - it doesnt really work

i was supposed to test all my tests first
it just doesnt work

live comparison of following injection patterns that just complicate code

if you can test it better, the code is good

"zombie astronatic architectures"

splitting up functions to support the testing process, destroys your system
architecture and code comprehension along with it. Test at a coarser level of
granularity

Test metrics
Coverage, Ratio & Speed

^--- that s what matters

"Just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean it's important"
Seth Godin

Cost != Value

TL;DR;
testing has value
TDD in my mind rarely has any value

"I get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to test
as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence - Kent Beck"

"Thinking yourself as Software Engineer - will lead you into the path 
of coverage, ratio & speed"

"I never thought about being one"

"It's about Clarity - it's about showing information in way that everyone
can understand it"

"if you want to be a good writer, isn't it just a matter of learning the
dictionary?"

"most important thing in a system is clarity"

"the clarity comes from a lot of coding - not reading"

"not enough by learning all pratices and memorizing patterns"

"i read the entire implementation of ruby before starting to build rails"

ruby is about implementation not about making the library small. This is
want to achieve with Rails

"ActiveRecord - can be 200 methods but isn't it very readable ? clarity ?"

"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead - 
Mark Twain"

Oh this code is too long, let me apply some patterns
