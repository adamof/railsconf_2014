### Writing software

- Learning to program through the computer science paradigms was hard, /wasn't clicking/
- Wasn't good at math /that's why rails is slow/
- Not a real programmer, like Linus Torvalds
- - He is improving Kernel, you are doing To-Do lists

The fact that you can construct a piano, doesn't mean you can play it well

Reading other people code is like literature /what the fuck did the guy mean/
Programming = pseudoscince & diets
- If I learn the secret, it will be awesome

How do I become a real programmer?
- Salvation: patterns and practices

TDD = the most successful diet in programming

Easy to test == better ? not really
- injecting dependencies

Zombie astonautic architectures
Priorities:
- easy tests
- fast tests
- architecture

Test metrics - coverage, ratio, speed ?? holy trinity

Testing is not free

Just because something is easy to measure, it doesn't mean it's important - Seth Godin

Cost != Value
- time spent in wrtiing the tests

Software engineer hat

Software writer
- writing = Clarity
"I know it when I see it"

Read read read code

### Readability
a lot of duplicate methods that do the same thing to improve readability
unless = if not

I didn't have enough time to write a short letter so I wrote a long one instead
