"Ego depletion"

"Cognitive depletion"

willpower
challenging tasks
cognitive dissonance
making choices
heated discussions

defaults - powerful weapon
- affect on both sides of spectrum
- keep you up on the high state


yatch shaving (?)
- it depletes you

people find all excuses to argue with what has
just been said

"we confessed commonality"

People go mental and think they need this very specific app
just for their needs

arguing freedom - sneaking argument to complain about defaults

"The law of leaky abstractions"

abstractions:
- do they leak?
- do they make our lifes easier?
- Rails => Rack => Ruby => POSIX
- standartization

"it's all about managing complexity - Steve Jobs"
abstractions are all about you not have to worry 90% about the rest

"open step - Steve Jobs"

start on 400th floor

nodejs 
- a bigger area of experimentation (this leaks)

rails
- you do not need to worry about it anymore - we have
thought about it - we have decided what leaks or not

Rails is not the only way to share

communities should put their power on shared solutions

rails has proved shared solutions - people do not need to 
think about their special needs

10y of building abstractions
