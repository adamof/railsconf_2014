Psychological hacks
defaults!!
- Opt In vs Opt Out

- - for example, 4 hours of setting up vagrant env
- Push back the impulse to feel "One of a kind and special"
- - "I need to use special tools"
- - The law of leaky abstractions
- - Abstractions are not bad. Not pile of hacks
- Shared solutions

- - That's what makes a community a good one

Build higher and stick together!
