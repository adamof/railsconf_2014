Q: What is the most important thing to teach a novice dev
- love and learn how to code
- get a job where you can continue to learn
- understand how to tackle dificult problems into smaller easier solvable problems
- willing to admit you do not know something

Q: How to help people build confidence:
- try to be humble. it is not you, this is hard but we can do it.
- Encourage people to ask questions - it is ok to not know that
- Focus first on fundamentals
- You are not terrible if you can do one thing right. Re-enforcing
tiny victories.

A lot of novices come from different backgrounds and end up bringing a new
vision. Could lead teams. Etc.. 

Q: How to make new generation of developers can be leader and/or mentors
- Meetups
- Engineering empathy - students all go in feedback sessions
- Experienced people should not make themselfs busy or uninterested when
a newbie needs help
- Lightning talks to newcomers

Q: Are you not scared to bring newcomers to bring to this industry?
- We desperate need to bring those people, there is a lot of demand. Having a
mismatch between need and supply it might affect the community because other
technologies will be picked

Q: Are you not going to need more seniors if you keep bringing apprentices?
- Not necessarily because you can spend 6 months waiting for a senior and not
find anyone but having a bunch of apprentices for 6 months you can probably
have devs that can produce as much as someone with 2y of experience


When someone tells me to write code in a whiteboard, I ask them how am i going
to run my tests?
Pair-programming on a real problem to asses skills

we spend time to make women feel comfortable talk about tech (said by Liz?)
Do you want be a professional developer? If no, do not come
